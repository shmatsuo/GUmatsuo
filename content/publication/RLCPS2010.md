# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Governments and international standards bodies have estab- lished certification procedures for security-critical technologies, such as cryptographic algorithms. Such standards have not yet been established for cryptographic protocols and hence it is difficult for users of these pro- tocols to know whether they are trustworthy. This is a serious problem as many protocols proposed in the past have failed to achieve their stated security properties. In this paper, we propose a framework for certifying cryptographic protocols. Our framework specifies procedures for both protocol designers and evaluators for certifying protocols with respect to three different assurance levels. This framework is being standard- ized as ISO/IEC 29128 in ISO/IEC JTC1 SC27/WG3, in which three of the authors are project co-editors. As a case study in the application of our proposal, we also present the plan for the open evaluation of entity- authentication protocols within the CRYPTREC project."
