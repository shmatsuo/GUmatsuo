abstract = "Many services on ITS (Intelligent transport sys- tem) have been proposed, which include the ETC (electronic toll collection) system. In this paper, we first present some assump- tions we can assume on ITS. Then we construct a light electronic ticket system which is suitable for payment on ITS. In our sys- tem, (1) only two moves are required to use a ticket, (2) the shop can check the validity of the ticket with only a few applying of hash functions. Further, we prove that forgery of a ticket by a user or a shop is detected with almost one probability."
